* Unet_using_pretrained_backbone(MobileNetV2 - pytorch).ipynb => In this code, I have used MobileNetv2 as backbone and added couple of transpose conolution to imitate
  U-net. At the end, a segmentation mask will be created for a person face. Just for comparison, I have also used another model with complete pretrained unet with mobilenet
  from segmentation models pytorch to see how it does in contrast to my code. Thanks for reading :)

* [CNN]dogs_vs_cats.ipynb: It' s a traditional CNN classifier to distinguish dogs and cats with accuracy around 85 percent. Of course, I haven' t using any transfer learning here.

* Mnist_using_DNN_and_CNN.ipynb: Here, I have made 12 different architectures(11 DNN and 1 CNN) and differences can be seen between using more non linear layers and less. More layers
  are not always better.
