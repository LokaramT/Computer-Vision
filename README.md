* Unet_using_pretrained_backbone(MobileNetV2 - pytorch).ipynb => MobileNetv2 as backbone is used and added corresponding transpose conv2d layers to build
  U-net network. This network is used to segment faces by training the RGB data with face masked image as target. Due to the limitations in the availability of target(masked image) data, the accuracy is limited to a certain cap.
